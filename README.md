# Python-Journey
Starting my Python Journey.

It's exciting as well as intimidating, but I'm starting my Python Learning with daily goals and projects.
I hope to overcome my doubts and fear surrounding this field and hopefully achieve a level of expertise that makes me confident in calling myself a Python Developer.
I'm aware of the market and that the traditional coding practices are not as prevailing and beneficial today, but I hope I can find my place in this community, adapting to new technology and trends.

I aim to post my progress through this journey on this platform, my learnings and projects as well as my challenges and participate in this community of well established Python Developers as well as learners like me.
I won't push every project I make, but a summary of those that hold less significance and rest I'll push to track my progress and hopefully gain some constructive feedback too.

All the best to me! Thank you!
